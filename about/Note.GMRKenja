As a child, like most young children, initially I had no sense of purpose, goals, or dreams. In fact, I was in a refugee camp for 15 years of my first 18 years. As a result, my outlook and perspectives on life were limited for a long time. However, as I grew up, there were positive people around me, in various places around the world, and they motivated me to start thinking about the future – and especially my future.  I was interested in doing makeup, studying and readings and also becoming a model, especially in the United States, and I wondered what options might be possible in my life. I dreamed of one day coming to the U.S. not because my life would be easy but because I knew that there were many opportunities that I could get and embrace in order to be successful in the future. 

This notebook means a lot to me, because as a child in the refugee camp we did not have all the resources that a lot of children and young people have here in the U.S. sometimes my parents could only afford one notebook every academic year and they had to cut that note book in three pieces in order to make sure that I can use that one notebook in all my classes and all academic year. This is why this notebook is so important, it reminds me of my past life that I endured and what I am supposed to do in the present to ensure that my future is secured. 

This clothes reminds me of how some things can be seen as fortune or gold in some part of the globe and other part seen as just a normal thing. It was not easy for us to afford clothing, sometimes we had to wait for Christmas, especially new year to get some clothes in the place where we grew up. When I look back on my past in comparison to my present I realized that I should always appreciate the little things we have in life.

The more I live, the more I learn about the world around me. I have now decided on three different choices that I would like to pursue. One of the choices that inspires me is leadership. I would love to be a well-respected leader for other people to look up to. In a leadership role, I would love to help other people to become productive citizens and live in peace. To help others, If I have an opportunity, I will be helping children with the notebooks to make sure they don’t suffer like I did at my early age.
